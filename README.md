🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction During Exercise – Machine Learning Model
This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activity using machine learning techniques. It combines data-driven modeling with thoughtful feature design to deliver personalized and insightful predictions.

The main emphasis of this work was on 🔍 feature engineering. We carefully selected and engineered meaningful features such as season, body temperature, calories consumed, heart rate, age, and gender to ensure the model captures real-world variations and personal factors that influence calorie expenditure.

To build a reliable and high-performance model, we used the ⚙️ XGBoost algorithm, known for its efficiency and strong predictive capabilities in regression tasks. The model was trained and evaluated on processed fitness-related data to ensure accurate outcomes.

This project serves as a strong foundation for health and fitness analytics, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to create smarter, personalized wellness tools. With further development, it can be integrated into larger systems such as fitness apps or wearable tech platforms for real-time tracking and guidance.
